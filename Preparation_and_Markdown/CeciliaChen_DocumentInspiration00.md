# Cecilia Chen - Document Inspiration 
DO NOT explain how the site works and what is on the site; explain why it is interesting to me 

### Website 1: https://le-mugs.com/en/
Why I Like It 
1. The left side has diamond-shaped dots to show how far along in the page the user is. I've seen dots, rounded rectangles, and more, but never diamonds that go down vertically as the user scrolls up and down. It gives it a modern and classy look that I like. It is also a running motif throughout the website, which looks so unified. 
2. The colour scheme makes the entire website so relaxing and pleasing to look at due to the ocean-side-like colours. 
3. The opaque boxes that separate the page with the sections are transparent enough where the user can see the fixed image at the top, which makes the website cohesive and put-together. 
The spacious area the website has for each blurb and picture makes everything breathe and easier to read and digest. 

### Website 2: https://barbombon.com 
Why I Like It 
1. The image at the front and top of the website shifts as mouse shifts around to catch the attention of the user. 
2. Each section takes up the entire screen of the website, which notifies the user that it is a different section. As users scroll, the objects move, which is so creative to me! It makes people pay attention to moving objects. 
3. The cohesive typography that transcends all the different pictures and sections is the baseline of the entire website, which I may want to try. I try to have at least 3 different fonts when designing a website, but everything was spaced out and that the single type of typography was efficiently communicating what it needs to.  
4. In the "Take a Look at the Menu" section, the line that guides the user's eyes to the food they display on the side before they get to their menu. This is an interesting way to get people to look at the food subtly, since menus normally are only in word-form. I love how creative it is and important to market your food!  

### Website 3: https://umamiland.withgoogle.com/en 
Why I Like it 
1. Umami Land is so interactive as the shape of the buttons change when the user hovers over them, turns into a shape that is thematic to the shapes of food in the background. This is so interesting to me because I would have just made the button change colour, but instead Umami Land changes the entire button to fit into the entire atmosphere to get your attention. 
2. Can go on an adventure to learn more about Japanese cuisine with the echoing / rippled effect around the search icon. I understood that it was to draw attention to itself, but it was interesting the search icon had a bouncy character to it, which fits the theme of the entire website. 
3. Colour scheme is pastel-like, soft, opaque, and pleasant to look at, whilst there is enough contrast to make certain foods and objects pop out. I would have expected the entire spectrum of colours, but they did stick to a specific colour scheme for each place. 


### Website 4: https://kissmanga.org 
Why I Dislike It 
1. The website's colour scheme (shades of blue and black) blends in with the blue tags related to the genres and labels of each manga. Because of that, the entire website is so similar in each section. Although I know that there are different sections and categories, it would be better if there was at least 1 more colour added into the colour scheme to emphasise and differentiate the headers. 
2. The words are too small, the page is so condensed, the manga covers are also not big enough. All of that makes everything hard to read, therefore making the entire experience miserable to use. 
3. I don't like how the search bar is on the side. I wish the search bar was in the center, so it could be more accessible and larger. 
4. Some edges of headers are curved. Which are nice. But there are inconsistencies. So I would like most to everything on this site to be curved, including the manga cover corners, section headers, buttons.
